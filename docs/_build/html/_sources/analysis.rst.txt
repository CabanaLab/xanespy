Analyzing the Data
==================

Forking the Data
----------------

After long computations it can be helpful to create a copy of the
dataset as a sort of checkpoint. To enable this, xanespy includes the
``fork_data_group()`` method: it creates a copy of the HDF group. The
active set can be changed by setting the ``data_name`` attribute on a
``XanesFrameset`` object. Most operations enabled by the
``XanesFrameset()`` class are not idempotent, so starting from a clean
dataset may be necessary:

.. code:: python

   import xanespy
   # Select an imported hdf file to use
   frameset = xanespy.XanesFrameset(hdf_filename="...")
   # Make sure we're starting with clean data
   frameset.data_name = "imported"

   # Create a copy as a checkpoint
   frameset.fork_data_group("aligned")
   # Do some work that we're not sure will succeed
   frameset.align_frames(passes=5)

   # If the alignment doesn't work right,
   # we can switch back to the original data and try again
   frameset.data_name = "imported"
   frameset.fork_data_group("aligned")
   frameset.align_frames(passes=3)

The :py:meth:`~xanespy.xanes_frameset.XanesFrameset.fork_data_group` method can be slow for large datasets. Xanespy
will raise exceptions for non-sensical requests for forking: trying to
copy a group onto itself, using a datagroup that doesn't exist, etc.


Frame Alignment
---------------

In order to acquire reliable spectra, **it is important that the
frames be aligned properly**. Thermal expansion, motor slop, sample
damage and imperfect microscope alignment can all cause frames to be
misaligned. **It is often necessary to align the frames before
performing any of the subsequent steps.**

This is done with the ``xanespy.XanesFrameset().align_frames()`` method::

  import xanespy
  # Select an imported hdf file to use
  frameset = xanespy.XanesFrameset(hdf_filename="...")
  
  # Run through five passes of the default phase correlation
  frameset.align_frames(passes=5, plot_results=True)

.. figure:: images/alignment-boxplot.svg
   :alt: Box and whisker plot of translations.

   With the ``plot_results`` argument, a box and whisker plot is
   generated showing the distribution of corrections needed for
   aligning each frame. Several passes help reduce the error.

The alignments are generally done with subpixel resolution, which
gives improved accuracy, but requires interpolation. To avoid problems
with accumulated error, a cumulative translation matrix is kept and
applied at the end to the original data. You can add your own
translation manually using the ``stage_transformations()`` method. If
``align_frames()`` is called with ``commit=False``, then the alignment
parameters are added to ``stage_transformations`` but not
applied. Once all transformations are staged, the
``apply_transformations()`` method will apply the cumulative
transformation matrix and (by default) save the result to disk.

If the starting alignment is particularly sporadic, a false minimum
can result in an exception or a very small image that doesn't provide
useful information. In these cases, it may be necessary to first stage
a template registration then perform several passes of phase
correlation::

  fs = XanesFrameset(hdf_filename="...")
  # Eg. use the 22nd energy and a range of the image as the template
  template = fs.frames()[21, 110:425, 150:450]
  plt.imshow(template, cmap="gray")

  fs.fork_data_group('aligned')

  fs.align_frames(method="template_match", template=template, commit=False)
  fs.align_frames(passes=5, commit=True)


Subtracting Surroundings
------------------------

Some microscopes show differences in the absorbance of the whole
frame, including background material. This can be removed from each
frame, giving a better spectrum::

  fs = XanesFrameset(hdf_filename="...")
  fs.subtract_surroundings()

.. figure:: images/subtract-surroundings.svg
